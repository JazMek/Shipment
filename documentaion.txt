A Shipment has a source port and destination port and in between these two ports,
  each Shipment will pass through several intermediate ports. A Shipment will carry
  the details of an estimated date to reach the destination port from the source port .
  The estimated date is also carried forward between each intermediate ports, where
  the estimated date on the Shipment will denote the date to reach that intermediate port.

Get the details of a Shipment with the expected date of delivery.
  Also get the number of shipment status available for that shipment,
  meaning the number of intermediate traversals. Write a program to
  compare if the expected date on the final status of the shipment
  and the actual expected date of the Shipment and display whether
  the Shipment has arrived 'on time' or 'before' or 'after' the expected date.

This problem has a One to Many relationship between the Shipment and Shipment
  Status as 'one shipment can have many statuses'.
